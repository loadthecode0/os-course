- OS abstract and manage resources
	- The OS as an extended machine
	- The OS as a resource manager
		- **Multiplexing:** Resources are shared in two ways:
			- **Time Multiplexing:** Users/programs take turns using resources (e.g., CPU scheduling).
			- **Space Multiplexing:** Resources are divided among users/programs simultaneously (e.g., memory partitioning).
