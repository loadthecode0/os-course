- instruction pipelining
- superscalar CPU -> in modern architectures
- Multithreading
	- pseudo parallel
	- exploits idle time
	- CPU is able to hold the state of two execution threads and switch between them super fast
	- E.g: one thread is fetching data from memory (slow), CPU switches to other thread while the first is waiting.
- Multiple processors (4, 8, 16, ...)
	- True parallelism
	- Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) -> extreme parallelism 
		- (but is very basic operations)
